This document allows an e-marketplace infrastructure to be created by connecting a set of interacting microservices. This infrastructure is fundamentally decentralized or federated, although all the services can exist on a single cloud. This specification does NOT assume any specific implementation architecture or technology. Rather, it defines the actors and the interfaces that need to be implemented by the transacting entities.

E-marketplaces enable trade of products and/or services via electronic media. This is supported by innovative information and communication technologies to match supply and demand. A **government e-marketplace** enables the trade of products and/or services, where at least one of the transacting parties taking part in the transaction is the government or a government appointed body.&#x20;
